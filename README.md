# RETROTube's old source code

![real](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/874110967011741768/939286892124471326/retro.png)

just a modified version of typicalname0 (bhief)'s youtube 2007 recreation lol

so enjoy i guess sdijosdjfk;asd

## NOTICE
the source code is so fucking messy and the site could be a bit shitty
also site is vulnerable so if you are gonna use this code, atleast make your youtube revival private,
or sanitize the shitty code that has retrotube. (if you know what are you doing)

however, RETROTube/LimeTube dosent use this source anymore (probably),
so feel free to use this if you want, modify it, change it, just go crazy, as long as you credit me (which i modified the source code a bit) and the original creator of the source code (bhief).

flarf used this code, now he uses subrocks source code so ummm!!!!!!!!!
yeah, thats all
