# RETROTube's old source code
just a modified version of typicalname0's youtube 2007 recreation lol
yeah we are rebranding retrotube, so the owner gave me permission to open source it

so enjoy i guess sdijosdjfk;asd

## BE CAREFUL
the source code is so fucking messy and the site could be vulnerable to exploits

however, RETROTube/LimeTube dosent use this source anymore due to its shitty php source,
so feel free to use this if you want, modify it, change it, just go crazy dude.

you can go visit the new site [here!](http:/limetube.ml)
