# RETROTube's old source code
just a modified version of typicalname0's youtube 2007 recreation lol

so enjoy i guess sdijosdjfk;asd

## NOTICE
the source code is so fucking messy and the site could be a bit shitty

however, RETROTube/LimeTube dosent use this source anymore (probably),
so feel free to use this if you want, modify it, change it, just go crazy dude.

you can go visit the new site [here! (the site is already dead so dont go there lmao)](http:/limetube.ml)


flarf uses this code btw, he said its really cool, [check his youtube revival](https://vaptube.vaporgame.xyz/)
